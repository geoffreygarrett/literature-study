synthetic tracking and the new generation of small and capable interplanetary

by taking multiple fast exposures. With synthetic tracking, an 800 sec
observation with a 10 cm telescope in space can detect a moving object with
apparent magnitude of 20.5 without losing sensitivity from streaking. We refer
to NEOs with a minimum orbit intersection distance of $< 0.002$ au as
Earth-grazers (EGs), representing typical albedo distributions. We show that a
constellation of six SmallSats (comparable in size to 9U CubeSats) equipped
with 10 cm synthetic tracking cameras and evenly-distributed in 1.0 au
heliocentric orbit could detect 90% of EGs with $\rm H \leq 22~mag$ in

Abstract      = {Multiple terrestrial and space-based telescopes have been proposed for
detecting and tracking near-Earth objects (NEOs). Detailed simulations of the
search performance of these systems have used complex computer codes that are
not widely available, which hinders accurate cross-comparison of the proposals
and obscures whether they have consistent assumptions. Moreover, some proposed
instruments would survey infrared (IR) bands, whereas others would operate in
the visible band, and differences among asteroid thermal and visible light
models used in the simulations further complicate like-to-like comparisons. I
use simple physical principles to estimate basic performance metrics for the
ground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and three space-based instruments
- Sentinel, NEOCam, and a Cubesat constellation. The performance is measured
against two different NEO distributions, the Bottke et al. distribution of
general NEOs, and the Veres et al. distribution of Earth impacting NEO. The
results of the comparison show simplified relative performance metrics,
including the expected number of NEOs visible in the search volumes and the
initial detection rates expected for each system. Although these simplified
comparisons do not capture all of the details, they give considerable insight
into the physical factors limiting performance. Multiple asteroid thermal
models are considered, including FRM, NEATM, and a new generalized form of FRM
(GFRM). I describe issues with how IR albedo and emissivity have been estimated
in previous studies, which may render them inaccurate. A thermal model for
tumbling asteroids is also developed and suggests that tumbling asteroids may
be surprisingly difficult for IR telescopes to observe.},

Moreover, some proposed instruments would survey infrared (IR) bands, whereas others would operate in the visible band, and differences among asteroid thermal and visible light models used in the simulations further complicate like-to-like comparisons. I use simple physical principles to estimate basic performance metrics for the ground-based Large Synoptic Survey Telescope and three space-based instruments - Sentinel, NEOCam, and a Cubesat constellation. The performance is measured against two different NEO distributions, the Bottke et al. distribution of general NEOs, and the Veres et al. distribution of Earth impacting NEO. The results of the comparison show simplified relative performance metrics, including the expected number of NEOs visible in the search volumes and the initial detection rates expected for each system. Although these simplified comparisons do not capture all of the details, they give considerable insight into the physical factors limiting performance. Multiple asteroid thermal models are considered, including FRM, NEATM, and a new generalized form of FRM (GFRM). I describe issues with how IR albedo and emissivity have been estimated in previous studies, which may render them inaccurate. A thermal model for tumbling asteroids is also developed and suggests that tumbling asteroids may be surprisingly difficult for IR telescopes to observe.

Abstract      = {Near-Earth objects (NEOs) moving in resonant, Earth-like orbits are
potentially important. On the positive side, they are the ideal targets for
robotic and human low-cost sample return missions and a much cheaper
alternative to using the Moon as an astronomical observatory. On the negative
side and even if small in size (2-50 m), they have an enhanced probability of
colliding with the Earth causing local but still significant property damage
and loss of life. Here, we show that the recently discovered asteroid 2013 BS45
is an Earth co-orbital, the sixth horseshoe librator to our planet. In contrast
with other Earth's co-orbitals, its orbit is strikingly similar to that of the
Earth yet at an absolute magnitude of 25.8, an artificial origin seems
implausible. The study of the dynamics of 2013 BS45 coupled with the analysis
of NEO data show that it is one of the largest and most stable members of a
previously undiscussed dynamically cold group of small NEOs experiencing
repeated trappings in the 1:1 commensurability with the Earth. This new
resonant family is well constrained in orbital parameter space and it includes
at least 10 other transient members: 2003 YN107, 2006 JY26, 2009 SH2 and 2012
FC71 among them. 2012 FC71 represents the best of both worlds as it is locked
in a Kozai resonance and is unlikely to impact the Earth. Objects in this group
could be responsible for the production of Earth's transient irregular natural

Near-Earth objects (NEOs) moving in resonant, Earth-like orbits are potentially important. On the positive side, they are the ideal targets for robotic and human low-cost sample return missions and a much cheaper alternative to using the Moon as an astronomical observatory. On the negative side and even if small in size (2-50 m), they have an enhanced probability of colliding with the Earth causing local but still significant property damage and loss of life. Here, we show that the recently discovered asteroid 2013 BS45 is an Earth co-orbital, the sixth horseshoe librator to our planet. In contrast with other Earth's co-orbitals, its orbit is strikingly similar to that of the Earth yet at an absolute magnitude of 25.8, an artificial origin seems implausible. The study of the dynamics of 2013 BS45 coupled with the analysis of NEO data show that it is one of the largest and most stable members of a previously undiscussed dynamically cold group of small NEOs experiencing repeated trappings in the 1:1 commensurability with the Earth. This new resonant family is well constrained in orbital parameter space and it includes at least 10 other transient members: 2003 YN107, 2006 JY26, 2009 SH2 and 2012 FC71 among them. 2012 FC71 represents the best of both worlds as it is locked in a Kozai resonance and is unlikely to impact the Earth. Objects in this group could be responsible for the production of Earth's transient irregular natural satellites.

cannot be excluded; in both cases, the orbit was very Earth-like, with low
eccentricity and low inclination, typical of an Arjuna-type meteoroid. A few

  Aims. Here, we study the short-term dynamical evolution of four recently
discovered near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) --2012 FC71, 2014 EK24, 2014 QD364, and
2014 UR-- that follow very Earth-like orbits.
  Methods. Our analysis is based on results of direct N-body calculations that
use the most updated ephemerides and include perturbations from the eight major
planets, the Moon, the barycentre of the Pluto-Charon system, and the three
largest asteroids.
  Results. These four NEAs exhibit an orbital evolution unlike any other known
near-Earth object (NEO). Beyond horseshoe, tadpole, or quasi-satellite
trajectories, they follow co-orbital passing orbits relative to the Earth
within the Kozai domain. Our calculations show that secular interactions induce
librations of their relative argument of perihelion with respect to our planet
but also to Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. Secular chaos is also present. The size
of this transient population is probably large.
  Conclusions. Although some of these NEAs can remain orbitally stable for many
thousands of years, their secular dynamics are substantially more complicated
than commonly thought and cannot be properly described within the framework of
the three-body problem alone owing to the overlapping of multiple secular
resonances. Objects in this group are amongst the most atypical NEOs regarding

The system correctly predicts the then-imminent impacts of 2008 TC3 and 2014 AA based on the first data sets available. Using the same code and configuration we find that the impact probabilities for objects typically on the NEOCP, based on 8 weeks of continuous operations, are always less than 1 in 10 million whereas simulated and real Earth-impacting asteroids always have an impact probability greater than 10% based on the first two tracklets available.

These wide-field telescopes of 50cm of aperture were manufactured by Perkin-

specifications. The TFRM is a fully robotic refurbished BNC that exploits the
excellent mechanical and optical original design to obtain an equatorial
telescope with a useful 4.4{\deg}x4.4{\deg} CCD field of view. TFRM is
therefore a European asset very well suited for SST (satellites and space

Nowadays, the unrelenting growth of man-made objects together with the overcrowding of the useful satellite orbits, and the real space debris and NEO hazards, has made necessary to carry out surveys of the space looking for uncatalogued objects. Optical telescopes play a key role in the Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) as a primary Space Situational Awareness element and, it is known, that the best instrument for this task is a fully robotic wide-field telescope with a minimum aperture of 40cm.  The Baker-Nunn Cameras (BNCs) were produced by the Smithsonian Institution during the late 50s as an optical tracking system for artificial satellites. These wide-field telescopes of 50cm of aperture were manufactured by Perkin- Elmer (optics) and Boller & Chivens (mechanics) with the highest quality specifications. The TFRM is a fully robotic refurbished BNC that exploits the excellent mechanical and optical original design to obtain an equatorial telescope with a useful 4.4{\deg}x4.4{\deg} CCD field of view. TFRM is therefore a European asset very well suited for SST (satellites and space debris) and NEO observations. Moreover, its control system allows tracking of all kinds of orbits, including LEOs.

(ATAP). The ultimate goal is to generate a large catalog of calibrated bolide
lightcurves to provide an unprecedented data set which will be used to inform
meteor entry models on how incoming bodies interact with the Earth's atmosphere
and to infer the pre-entry properties of the impacting bodies. The data set
will also be useful for other asteroidal studies. This paper reports on the
progress of the first part of this ultimate goal, namely, the automated bolide
detection pipeline. Development of the training set, ML model training and
iterative improvements in detection performance are presented. The pipeline

The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) instrument onboard the GOES 16 and 17 satellites has been shown to be capable of detecting bolides (bright meteors) in Earth's atmosphere. Due to its large, continuous field of view and immediate public data availability, GLM provides a unique opportunity to detect a large variety of bolides, including those in the 0.1 to 3 m diameter range and complements current ground-based bolide detection systems, which are typically sensitive to smaller events. We present a machine learning-based bolide detection and light curve generation pipeline being developed at NASA Ames Research Center as part of NASA's Asteroid Threat Assessment Project (ATAP). The ultimate goal is to generate a large catalog of calibrated bolide lightcurves to provide an unprecedented data set which will be used to inform meteor entry models on how incoming bodies interact with the Earth's atmosphere and to infer the pre-entry properties of the impacting bodies. The data set will also be useful for other asteroidal studies. This paper reports on the progress of the first part of this ultimate goal, namely, the automated bolide detection pipeline. Development of the training set, ML model training and iterative improvements in detection performance are presented. The pipeline runs in an automated fashion and bolide lightcurves along with other measured properties are promptly published on a NASA hosted publicly accessible website, https://neo-bolide.ndc.nasa.gov.

goal of the project is to provide two fully robotic telescopes, which will
serve as prototypes for development of a future network. The system consists of
two telescopes, one in Spain and the second one in the Southern Hemisphere. The
telescope is a fast astrograph with a large Field of View of 2.5 x 2.5
square-degrees and a plate scale of 2.2 arcsec/pixel. The tube is mounted on a
fast direct-drive mount moving with speed up to 20 degrees per second. The
focal plane hosts a 2-port 4K x 4K back-illuminated CCD with readout speeds up
to 1MHz per port. Detection software and hardware are optimised for the
detection of NEOs and objects in high Earth orbits (objects moving from 0.1-40
arcsec/second). Every night it takes all the input needed and prepares a
schedule following predefined rules allocating tasks for the telescopes.
Telescopes are managed by RTS2 control software, that performs the real-time
scheduling of the observation and manages all the devices at the observatory.1
At the end of the night the observing systems report astrometric positions and
photometry of the objects detected. The first telescope was installed in
Cebreros Satellite Tracking Station in mid-2015. We evaluate the site
characteristics and the performance of the TBT Cebreros telescope in the
different modes and strategies. Average residuals for asteroids are under 0.5
arcsecond, while they are around 1 arcsecond for upper-MEO and GEO satellites.
The survey depth is dimmer than magnitude 18.5 for 30-second exposures with the
usual seeing around 4 arcseconds.},
