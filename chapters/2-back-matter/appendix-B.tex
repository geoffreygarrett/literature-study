    a = \frac{p}{1-f^2-g^2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    e = \sqrt{f^2 + g^2}

\begin{equation}
    i = 2\tan^{-1}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}}=\textrm{atan2}(2\sqrt{h^2+k^2},1-h^2-k^2)

\begin{equation}
    i = 2\tan^{-1}{\sqrt{h^2+k^2}}=\textrm{atan2}(2\sqrt{h^2+k^2},1-h^2-k^2)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \omega=\tan^{-1}(g/f)-\tan^{-1}(k/h)=\textrm{atan2}(gh-fk, fh+gk)
