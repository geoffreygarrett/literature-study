\Gls{ML} is the field of computer science that deals with algorithms which improve through experience in the form of data~\cite{Mitchell97} and is often described as a proper subset of AI~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}. Intelligent technologies are being applied to a variety of tasks such as interpreting speech and images \cite{Farabet2013,Girshick2013,Chen2014,He2014,Shelhamer2014,Girshick2015,Ren2015,Redmon2015}, improving medical diagnoses and prognoses~\cite{Kourou2015, Abbasi2019, Singh2019, Rajkomar2019, May2021}, combatting climate change \cite{Rolnick2023}, and assisting with fundamental scientific research daily \cite{Libbrecht2015}. This field as a whole is still relatively young; its name was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel~\cite{5392560}, but significant progress in learning human-level tasks was delayed until the advent of \gls{DL}, a term given by Rina Dechter in 1986~\cite{Rina1986}. Nonetheless, human-like analysis of actual-world photographs was not achieved until the ImageNet database was created in 2009, which has been called the catalyst for the \gls{AI} revolution in the 21st century.


% Our daily lives exhibit wide applications of intelligent
% software to automate routine labour, understand speech or images, assist in
% diagnoses in medicine and support basic scientific research. This field as a
% whole is relatively young, having been coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel
% \cite{5392560}, however little progress in reaching human-comparable learning
% was achieved until the advent of deep learning, termed by Rina Dechter in 1986
% \cite{Rina1986}. 

Even then, human-like recognition of real-world images was not achieved until ImageNet was created in 2009 \cite{5206848}, which is often considered the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st-century \cite{hardy_2016}.


This chapter covers the core concepts of \gls{ML}, with dedicated sections for
its fundamentals and its subfields of \gls{DL} and \gls{RL}. The aforementioned fields' relationships are illustrated in \autoref{fig:al-ml-dl}.
