\chapter{Estimation Theory: Satellite Orbits}

Given the complexity of the models which depend on a variety of
parameters which are used in the description of the dynamic motion or
measurement process, it is customary to linearize the relations between
observables and the independent parameters in order to obtain expressions which
are more easily handled.
