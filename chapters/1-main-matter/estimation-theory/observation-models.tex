\section{Spacecraft Tracking \& Observation Models}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

It should be noted that significant work towards the incorporation of laser
tracking for Lunar~\cite{Bauer2016, Bauer2017} and planetary science missions
have been carried out, and has demonstrated that range observations may be
improved by 2 orders of magnitude~\cite{Dirkx2019}. However, the primary purpose
of this research is the autonomous planning for the safe exploration of small
bodies, therefore the use of Interplanetary Laser Ranging (ILR) is considered
beyond the current scope, and is not covered by this work.

%In order to provide a fundamental view of estimation in the context of space
%missions, we generalize across what is implied by tracking, observation, and
%characterization of the space environment. Information is transmitted to an
%observer in the form of a signal, which has some identity associated to it.
%This signal is then

\subsection{Radar Tracking}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Radar tracking facilitates the determination of specific physical information of
a spacecraft, with respect to the path of signals taken though the defining
link-ends: transmitter and receiver, and in some configurations, transponders
(transmission of a signal in response to a received signal). The components of
physical information determinable between link-ends are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{pointing angles}: determined by either (a) measuring the
    direction of the maximum signal amplitude of the spacecraft with respect to
    a single observer, or (b) Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) using
    multiple observers, given accurate relative fixed positions of the
    observers.
    \item \textit{range}: \textit{a.k.a. line-of-sight distance}, determined by
    the measuring the light trip time between A and B. This is most configured
    such that round-trip light time is measured, the duration between the
    emission of a signal from A, reflected at B, and received again by A.
    One-way configuration is also possible, with more stringent requirements on
    time precision.
    \item \textit{range rate}: \textit{a.k.a. line-of-sight velocity}, of
    a B with respect to an observer A can be derived from the Doppler shift
    of a radar wave. The most common configurations for these measurements are
    one-way, two-way and three-way.
\end{enumerate}

Radar tracking is the most used widely used form deep space spacecraft tracking
and is facilitated by a network of dedicated ground stations. Two popular
networks used in contemporary deep space spacecraft tracking are ESA's tracking
station network (ESTRACK) \cite{Doat2018} and NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN)
\cite{Dsn2015}. These networks generally operate in the X-band or Ka-band, or
both to account for dispersive propagation media \cite{Bertotti1993}. These
bands are designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
\cite{Berner2020}, and given in \autoref{tab:itu-bands}.

\subsubsection{Deep Space Network (DSN)}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The Deep Space Network (DSN) first developed the unified S-band (USB) system for
spacecrafts during the 1960s, during the Apollo missions~\cite{Peltzer1966}. It
has since been accompanied by the X-band, K-band and most recently, the Ka-band.

\begin{itemize}
    \item One-way: The spacecraft generates the downlink signal(s) from an
    onboard oscillator. The DSN compares the received frequency against a
    locally generated frequency
    \item Two-way: The DSN transmits a signal to the spacecraft. The spacecraft
    tracks the phase of the uplink signal and generates a phase coherent
    downlink signal. The DSN compares the received frequency with the same
    reference frequency from which the uplink was generated.
    \item Three-way: The spacecraft is tracked by two stations—one with the
    two-way mode while the other receives and compares the signal to a locally
    generated frequency. The most common application of this mode is during the
    handover between stations at two different Deep Space Communication
    Complexes (DSCCs).
    \item Coherent Three-way: Coherent three-way tracking is three-way tracking
    when the transmitting and receiving stations share a common frequency
    reference. This is possible at all three DSN complexes as all antennas at a
    complex share the same frequency reference.

\subsubsection{Doppler Measurements}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

To measure two-way or three-way Doppler shift, the spacecraft must transmit a
downlink signal that is phase coherent with the uplink signal. Table 1 provides
the recommended spacecraft transponder turnaround ratios for various uplink and
downlink frequency bands.

Doppler measurements are typically integrated of a period of about 60 seconds \cite{},
however periods in the lower range of 1-10 seconds \cite{}, or larger periods such as
1000 seconds may also be chosen \cite{}.

\begin{equation}
    \frac{f_r}{f_t} = \frac{
        1-\mathbf{v}_r\cdot{}\mathbf{e}/c + U_r/c^2 +\mathbf{v}_r^2/(2c^2)
    }{
        1-\mathbf{v}_t\cdot{}\mathbf{e}/c + U_t/c^2 +\mathbf{v}_t^2/(2c^2)
    }
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \textrm{where  }
        \mathbf{f}_t, \mathbf{f}_r &= \textrm{the transmitted and received signal frequencies,}\\
        \mathbf{v}_t, \mathbf{v}_t &= \textrm{the transmitters and receivers inertial velocity vectors,}\\
        \mathbf{e} &= \textrm{the unit vector in the direction of the signal propagation,}\\
        c &= \textrm{the speed of light,}\\
        \mathbf{U}_t, \mathbf{U}_r &= \textrm{the Newtonian potential at the trasmitter and receiver.}\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

The frequency shift, $f_r/f_t$ cannot be measured instantaneously and must be
time averaged over a counting period, $t_c$

\begin{equation}
    N = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}(f_r-f_{ref})dt
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{aligned}
        \textrm{where  }
        \mathbf{f}_t, \mathbf{f}_r &= \textrm{the transmitted and received signal frequencies,}\\
        \mathbf{v}_t, \mathbf{v}_t &= \textrm{the transmitters and receivers inertial velocity vectors,}\\
        \mathbf{e} &= \textrm{the unit vector in the direction of the signal propagation,}\\
        c &= \textrm{the speed of light,}\\
        \mathbf{U}_t, \mathbf{U}_r &= \textrm{the Newtonian potential at the trasmitter and receiver.}\\
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation}
    N = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}(f_r)dt-f_{ref}(t_2-t_1)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    N = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}(f_r)dt = T_{1,2}\int_{t_1-\tau_1}^{t_2-\tau_2}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \dot{\rho} = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}(f_r)dt = T_{1,2}\int_{t_1-\tau_1}^{t_2-\tau_2}

    \Delta{\overline{\dot{\rho}}} = \frac{\lambda\omega}{2\pi}\frac{s_R+s_T/T_{1,2}}{2}
\end{equation}



\subsection{Landmark Tracking}

Landmark tracking is facilitated by a perspective projection model, usually a
pin-hole camera model~\cite{Shuang2008} which allows for the mapping of 3D
positions to 2D image points, for simulation and navigational purposes.
Positions in the camera-fixed frame $(x^c, y^c, z^c)$, are mapped to pixel
points on the image plane $(u,v)$ according to the relations:

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        u&=f\frac{x^c}{z^c},\\
        v&=f\frac{y^c}{z^c}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The line-of-sight vector $b_i^c$ of the $i^{th}$ image point to the camera
exposure center in the camera-fixed frame is defined by:

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{b}_i^c=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\bar{x}_i^c)^2+(\bar{y}_i^c)^2+f^2}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    -\bar{x}^c_i \\
    -\bar{y}^c_i \\
    -f \\
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{I}_i^I=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(x^I_i - x^I)^2+(y^I_i - y^I)^2+(z^I_i - z^I)^2}}
    \begin{bmatrix}
    x^I_i - x^I \\
    y^I_i - y^I \\
    z^I_i - z^I \\
    \end{bmatrix},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\mathbf{b}}_i^c=\mathbf{A}\mathbf{I}_i^I
\end{equation}
