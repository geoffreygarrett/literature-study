\Gls{ML}, often described as a proper subset of \gls{AI}~\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016} and is the field of computer science that deals with the improvement of algorithms through experience and the use of data~\cite{Mitchell97}. Intelligent technologies are being applied to automate routine tasks, interpret speech and images, aid in medical diagnoses, and assist with basic scientific research on a daily basis. This field as a whole is still relatively young; it was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel~\cite{5392560}, but significant progress in achieving human-level learning was delayed until the advent of \gls{DL}, a term given by Rina Dechter in 1986~\cite{Rina1986}. Nonetheless, human-like analysis of actual-world photographs was not achieved until the ImageNet database was created in 2009, which has been called the catalyst for the \gls{AI} revolution in the 21st century.



% Our daily lives exhibit wide applications of intelligent
% software to automate routine labour, understand speech or images, assist in
% diagnoses in medicine and support basic scientific research. This field as a
% whole is relatively young, having been coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel
% \cite{5392560}, however little progress in reaching human-comparable learning
% was achieved until the advent of deep learning, termed by Rina Dechter in 1986
% \cite{Rina1986}. 

Even then, human-like recognition of real-world images was not achieved until ImageNet was created in 2009 \cite{5206848}, which is often considered as the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st century \cite{hardy_2016}.


This chapter covers the core concepts of \gls{ML}, with dedicated sections for
the fundamentals, and the subfields of \gls{DL}, and \gls{RL}. The relationships
between the aforementioned fields are illustrated \autoref{fig:al-ml-dl}.
