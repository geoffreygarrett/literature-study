    abstract = {Range measurements are used to improve the trajectory models of spacecraft tracked by the deep space network. The unique challenge of deep-space ranging is that the two-way delay is long, typically many minutes, and the signal-to-noise ratio is small. Accurate measurements are made under these circumstances by means of long correlations that incorporate Doppler rate-aiding. This processing is done with commercial digital signal processors, providing a flexibility in signal design that can accommodate both the traditional sequential ranging signal and pseudonoise range codes. Accurate range determination requires the calibration of the delay within the tracking station. Measurements with a standard deviation of 1 m have been made. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Measurements of the motion of natural (and artificial) bodies in the solar system provide key input on their interior structre and properties. Currently, the most accurate measurements of solar system dynamics are performed using radiometric tracking systems on planetary missions, providing range measurement with an accuracy in the order of 1 m. Laser ranging to Earth-orbiting satellites equipped with laser retroreflectors provides range data with (sub-)cm accuracy. Extending this technology to planetary missions, however, requires the use of an active space segment equipped with a laser detector and transmitter (for a two-way system). The feasibility of such measurements have been demonstrated at planetary distances, and used operationally (with a one-way system) for the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. The topic of this dissertation is the analysis of the application of interplanetary laser ranging (ILR) to improve the science return from next-generation space missions, with a focus on planetary science objectives. We have simulated laser ranging data for a variety of mission and system architectures, analyzing the influence of both model and measurement uncertainties. Our simulations show that the single-shot measurement precision is relatively inconsequential compared to the systematic range errors, providing a strong rationale for the consistent use of single-photon signal-intensity operation. We find that great advances in planetary geodesy (tidal, rotational characteristics, etc.) could be achieved by ILR. However, the laser data should be accompanied by commensurate improvements in other measurements and data analysis models to maximize the system's science return. The science return from laser ranging data will be especially strong for planetary landers, with a radio system remaining the preferred choice for many orbiter missions. Furthermore, we conclude that the science case for a one-way laser ranging is relatively weak compared to next-generation radiometric tracking systems, requiring the development of much more accurate space-based clocks.},

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to AI had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic AI approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the `research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate. }
