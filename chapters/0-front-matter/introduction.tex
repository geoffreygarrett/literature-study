    The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they
    mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with
    the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed
    phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and
    precisely that it is expected to work - that is correctly to describe
    phenomena from a reasonably wide area. Furthermore, it must satisfy certain
    aesthetic criteria - that is, in relation to how much it describes, it must
    be rather simple. - John von Neumann
