\Gls{ML}, often described as a proper subset of \gls{AI}
\cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016}, and is the field in computer science which deals
with the improvement of algorithms through experience and the use of data
\cite{Mitchell97}. Our daily lives exhibit wide applications of intelligent
software to automate routine labour, understand speech or images, assist in
diagnoses in medicine and support basic scientific research. This field as a
whole is relatively young, having been coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel
\cite{5392560}, however little progress in reaching human-comparable learning
was achieved until the advent of deep learning, termed by Rina Dechter in 1986
\cite{Rina1986}. Even then, human-like recognition of real-world images was not
achieved until ImageNet was created in 2009 \cite{5206848}, which is often
considered as the catalyst for the AI boom of the 21st century
\cite{hardy_2016}.

This chapter covers the core concepts of \gls{ML}, with dedicated sections for
the fundamentals, and the subfields of \gls{DL}, and \gls{RL}. The relationships
between the aforementioned fields are illustrated \autoref{fig:al-ml-dl}.
