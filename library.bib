    abstract = {Range measurements are used to improve the trajectory models of spacecraft tracked by the deep space network. The unique challenge of deep-space ranging is that the two-way delay is long, typically many minutes, and the signal-to-noise ratio is small. Accurate measurements are made under these circumstances by means of long correlations that incorporate Doppler rate-aiding. This processing is done with commercial digital signal processors, providing a flexibility in signal design that can accommodate both the traditional sequential ranging signal and pseudonoise range codes. Accurate range determination requires the calibration of the delay within the tracking station. Measurements with a standard deviation of 1 m have been made. {\textcopyright} 2006 IEEE.},

    abstract = {Measurements of the motion of natural (and artificial) bodies in the solar system provide key input on their interior structre and properties. Currently, the most accurate measurements of solar system dynamics are performed using radiometric tracking systems on planetary missions, providing range measurement with an accuracy in the order of 1 m. Laser ranging to Earth-orbiting satellites equipped with laser retroreflectors provides range data with (sub-)cm accuracy. Extending this technology to planetary missions, however, requires the use of an active space segment equipped with a laser detector and transmitter (for a two-way system). The feasibility of such measurements have been demonstrated at planetary distances, and used operationally (with a one-way system) for the Lunar Reconaissance Orbiter (LRO) mission. The topic of this dissertation is the analysis of the application of interplanetary laser ranging (ILR) to improve the science return from next-generation space missions, with a focus on planetary science objectives. We have simulated laser ranging data for a variety of mission and system architectures, analyzing the influence of both model and measurement uncertainties. Our simulations show that the single-shot measurement precision is relatively inconsequential compared to the systematic range errors, providing a strong rationale for the consistent use of single-photon signal-intensity operation. We find that great advances in planetary geodesy (tidal, rotational characteristics, etc.) could be achieved by ILR. However, the laser data should be accompanied by commensurate improvements in other measurements and data analysis models to maximize the system's science return. The science return from laser ranging data will be especially strong for planetary landers, with a radio system remaining the preferred choice for many orbiter missions. Furthermore, we conclude that the science case for a one-way laser ranging is relatively weak compared to next-generation radiometric tracking systems, requiring the development of much more accurate space-based clocks.},

In this article, we first examine AVs and different categories of the technological risks associated with them. We then explore strategies that can be adopted to address these risks, and explore emerging responses by governments for addressing AV risks. Our analyses reveal that, thus far, governments have in most instances avoided stringent measures in order to promote AV developments and the majority of responses are non-binding and focus on creating councils or working groups to better explore AV implications. The US has been active in introducing legislations to address issues related to privacy and cybersecurity. The UK and Germany, in particular, have enacted laws to address liability issues; other countries mostly acknowledge these issues, but have yet to implement specific strategies. To address privacy and cybersecurity risks strategies ranging from introduction or amendment of non-AV specific legislation to creating working groups have been adopted. Much less attention has been paid to issues such as environmental and employment risks, although a few governments have begun programmes to retrain workers who might be negatively affected.},

I devote particular attention to the proofs and arguments of Minsky and Papert, which were interpreted as showing that further progress in neural nets was not possible, and that this approach to AI had to be abandoned. I maintain that this official interpretation of the debate was a result of the emergence, institutionalization and (importantly) legitimation of the symbolic AI approach (with its resource allocation system and authority structure). At the `research-area' level, there was considerable interpretative flexibility. This interpretative flexibility was further demonstrated by the revival of neural nets in the late 1980s, and subsequent rewriting of the official history of the debate. }

    abstract = {We propose a new fast purely discriminative algorithm for natural language parsing, based on a “deep” recurrent convolutional graph transformer network (GTN). Assuming a decomposition of a parse tree into a stack of “levels”, the network predicts a level of the tree taking into account predictions of previous levels. Using only few basic text features, we show similar performance (in F1 score) to existing pure discriminative parsers and existing “benchmark” parsers (like Collins parser, probabilistic context-free grammars based), with a huge speed advantage.

    ABSTRACT = {Anomaly detection is an active area of research with numerous methods and applications. This survey reviews the state-of-the-art of data-driven anomaly detection techniques and their application to the aviation domain. After a brief introduction to the main traditional data-driven methods for anomaly detection, we review the recent advances in the area of neural networks, deep learning and temporal-logic based learning. In particular, we cover unsupervised techniques applicable to time series data because of their relevance to the aviation domain, where the lack of labeled data is the most usual case, and the nature of flight trajectories and sensor data is sequential, or temporal. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are presented in terms of computational efficiency and detection efficacy. The second part of the survey explores the application of anomaly detection techniques to aviation and their contributions to the improvement of the safety and performance of flight operations and aviation systems. As far as we know, some of the presented methods have not yet found an application in the aviation domain. We review applications ranging from the identification of significant operational events in air traffic operations to the prediction of potential aviation system failures for predictive maintenance.},

    abstract = {Machine learning has been the corner stone in analysing and extracting information from data and often a problem of missing values is encountered. Missing values occur because of various factors like missing completely at random, missing at random or missing not at random. All these may result from system malfunction during data collection or human error during data pre-processing. Nevertheless, it is important to deal with missing values before analysing data since ignoring or omitting missing values may result in biased or misinformed analysis. In literature there have been several proposals for handling missing values. In this paper, we aggregate some of the literature on missing data particularly focusing on machine learning techniques. We also give insight on how the machine learning approaches work by highlighting the key features of missing values imputation techniques, how they perform, their limitations and the kind of data they are most suitable for. We propose and evaluate two methods, the k nearest neighbor and an iterative imputation method (missForest) based on the random forest algorithm. Evaluation is performed on the Iris and novel power plant fan data with induced missing values at missingness rate of 5{\%} to 20{\%}. We show that both missForest and the k nearest neighbor can successfully handle missing values and offer some possible future research direction.},

A number of "no free lunch" (NFL) theorems are presented which establish that for any algorithm, any elevated performance over one class of problems is offset by performance over another class. These theorems result in a geometric interpretation of what it means for an algorithm to be well suited to an optimization problem. Applications of the NFL theorems to information-theoretic aspects of optimization and benchmark measures of performance are also presented. Other issues addressed include time-varying optimization problems and a priori "head-to-head" minimax distinctions between optimization algorithms, distinctions that result despite the NFL theorems' enforcing of a type of uniformity over all algorithms.},

Real world data and a simulation study show that the elastic net often outperforms the lasso, while enjoying a similar sparsity of representation. In addition, the elastic net encourages a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be in or out of the model together. The elastic net is particularly useful when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number of observations (n). By contrast, the lasso is not a very satisfactory variable selection method in the p≫n case. An algorithm called LARS‐EN is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently, much like algorithm LARS does for the lasso.},

The assumption can be precisely stated as follows:When an axon of cell A is near enough to excite cell B and repeatedly or persistently takes part in firing it, some growth process or metabolic change takes place in one or both cells such that A `s efficiency, as one of the cells firing B, is increased''.",

In a physiological approach described here, the patterns of synaptic connections in slices of developing ferret visual cortex were determined with scanning laser photostimulation. Functional synaptic inputs to pyramidal cells in cortical layers 2 and 3 originating from sites close to the neuronal cell body appeared at least 2 weeks before eye opening, prior to the formation of long-range horizontal connections. Extensive long-range horizontal connections appeared in the next 10 days of development. The number of local connections peaked at the time of eye opening; the number of these connections subsequently declined to the level found in the adult while the specificity of long-distance connections increased. Thus, the relative influence of local connections on the activity of layer 2 and layer 3 neurons declines as the cortex matures while the influence of longer range connections increases substantially. }

Although it is well known that such a term greatly improves the speed of learning, there have been few rigorous studies of its mechanisms. In this paper, I show that in the limit of continuous time, the momentum parameter is analogous to the mass of Newtonian particles that move through a viscous medium in a conservative force field. The behavior of the system near a local minimum is equivalent to a set of coupled and damped harmonic oscillators. The momentum term improves the speed of convergence by bringing some eigen components of the system closer to critical damping. Similar results can be obtained for the discrete time case used in computer simulations. In particular, I derive the bounds for convergence on learning-rate and momentum parameters, and demonstrate that the momentum term can increase the range of learning rate over which the system converges. The optimal condition for convergence is also analyzed.}

@generic{Sheu2020,
    abstract = {Psychiatric research is often confronted with complex abstractions and dynamics that are not readily accessible or well-defined to our perception and measurements, making data-driven methods an appealing approach. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are capable of automatically learning abstractions in the data that can be entirely novel and have demonstrated superior performance over classical machine learning models across a range of tasks and, therefore, serve as a promising tool for making new discoveries in psychiatry. A key concern for the wider application of DNNs is their reputation as a “black box” approach—i.e., they are said to lack transparency or interpretability of how input data are transformed to model outputs. In fact, several existing and emerging tools are providing improvements in interpretability. However, most reviews of interpretability for DNNs focus on theoretical and/or engineering perspectives. This article reviews approaches to DNN interpretability issues that may be relevant to their application in psychiatric research and practice. It describes a framework for understanding these methods, reviews the conceptual basis of specific methods and their potential limitations, and discusses prospects for their implementation and future directions.},

    abstract = {Asteroids and other small bodies in the solar system tend to have irregular shapes, owing to their low gravity. This irregularity does not only apply to the topology, but also to the underlying geology, potentially containing regions of different densities and materials. The topology can be derived from optical observations, while the mass density distribution of an object is only observable, to some extent, in its gravitational field. In a companion paper, we presented geodesyNets, a neural network approach to infer the mass density distribution of an object from measurements of its gravitational field. In the present work, we apply this approach to the asteroid Bennu using real data from the Osiris Rex mission. The mission measured the trajectories of not only the Osiris Rex spacecraft itself, but also of numerous pebble-sized rock particles which temporarily orbited Bennu. From these trajectory data, we obtain a representation of Bennu's mass density and validate it by propagating, in the resulting gravity field, multiple pebbles not used in the training process. The performance is comparable to that of a polyhedral gravity model of uniform density, but does not require a shape model. As little additional information is needed, we see this as a step towards autonomous on-board inversion of gravitational fields.},

This body of work is so far lacking a common framework and methodology. Moreover, approaching the analysis of modern neural networks can be difficult for newcomers to the field. This tutorial aims to fill this gap and introduce the nascent field of interpretability and analysis of neural networks in NLP. The tutorial will cover the main lines of analysis work, such as structural analyses using probing classifiers, behavioral studies and test suites, and interactive visualizations. We will highlight not only the most commonly applied analysis methods, but also the specific limitations and shortcomings of current approaches, in order to inform participants where to focus future efforts.",

A convolutional neural network is used to classify small “postage-stamp” images of candidate detections of astronomical sources into eight classes, followed by a multi-layered perceptron that provides a probability that a temporal sequence of four candidate detections represents a real astronomical source. The goal of this work is to reduce the time delay between Near-Earth Object (NEO) detections and submission to the Minor Planet Center. Due to the rare and hazardous nature of NEOs, a low false negative rate is a priority for the model. We show that the model reaches 99.6% accuracy on real asteroids in ATLAS data with a 0.4% false negative rate. Deployment of this model on ATLAS has reduced the amount of NEO candidates that astronomers must screen by 90%, thereby bringing ATLAS one step closer to full autonomy.}

Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the earth. This process parallels certain theories concerning the growth of the asteroid belt. The debris flux in such an earth-orbiting belt could exceed the natural meteoroid flux, affecting future spacecraft designs. A mathematical model was used to predict the rate at which such a belt might form. Under certain conditions the belt could begin to form within this century and could be a significant problem during the next century. The possibility that numerous unobserved fragments already exist from spacecraft explosions would decrease this time interval. However, early implementation of specialized launch constraints and operational procedures could significantly delay the formation of the belt.},

In contrast to previous works, this paper devotes to estimate the 3D pose of the unknown space object from a single image. Our method estimates not only the pose but also the shape of the unknown object from a single image. In this paper, a hierarchical shape model is proposed to represent the prior structure information of typical space objects. On this basis, the parameters of the pose and shape are estimated simultaneously for unknown space objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method to estimate the 3D pose and infer the geometry of unknown typical space objects from a single image.

    abstract = { Since nanosatellites are spotlighted as a verification platform for space technology, new studies on on-orbit satellite servicing using nanosatellites are being conducted. This servicing is based on space robotics using vision-based sensors in the rendezvous state with a target satellite. The space environment, such as sunlight and Earth albedo, affects the mission. Simulation of the space environment on the ground is difficult, but the development of robust algorithms which reflect the effect is essential. In particular, missions such as active debris removal require a method for overcoming changes in any known information due to external factors such as collisions. This study proposes a new strategy on nanosatellite for on-orbit space object classification by applying deep learning to sensor-based orbit satellite service activity. When previously known information is changed, a method of online learning on orbit after obtaining additional data at a short relative distance can help determine the final service part. Using the images and point cloud data that simulate the space environment, we apply a convolutional neural network and PointNet to classify the objects. The learning environment is studied using a general desktop and a micro-graphics processing unit (GPU) board that can be mounted on a nanosatellite. For the training, we used self-produced data using 3D models of nanosatellites and asteroids with similar shapes, which are difficult to distinguish with existing algorithms. Consequently, the proposed strategy by the author shows feasibility of using nanosatellite’s micro GPU for on-orbit space object classification, and it is verified that point cloud–based methods are more suitable by utilizing deep learning for nanosatellites. The proposed method with processor of nanosatellite is applicable to satellite service missions in orbit, such as capturing of robotic parts for extending life span or removing space debris. }

    abstract = {Conventional gravity field expressions are derived from Laplace's equation, the result being the spherical harmonic gravity field. This gravity field is said to be the exterior spherical harmonic gravity field, as its convergence region is outside the Brillouin (i.e., circumscribing) sphere of the body. In contrast, there exists its counterpart called the interior spherical harmonic gravity field for which the convergence region lies within the interior Brillouin sphere that is not the same as the exterior Brillouin sphere. Thus, the exterior spherical harmonic gravity field cannot model the gravitation within the exterior Brillouin sphere except in some special cases, and the interior spherical harmonic gravity field cannot model the gravitation outside the interior Brillouin sphere. In this paper, we will discuss two types of other spherical harmonic gravity fields that bridge the null space of the exterior/interior gravity field expressions by solving Poisson's equation. These two gravity fields are obtained by assuming the form of Helmholtz's equation to Poisson's equation. This method renders the gravitational potentials as functions of spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonic coefficients. We refer to these gravity fields as the interior/exterior spherical Bessel gravity fields and study their characteristics. The interior spherical Bessel gravity field is investigated in detail for proximity operation purposes around small primitive bodies. Particularly, we apply the theory to asteroids Bennu (formerly 1999 RQ36) and Castalia to quantify its performance around both nearly spheroidal and contact-binary asteroids, respectively. Furthermore, comparisons between the exterior gravity field, interior gravity field, interior spherical Bessel gravity field, and polyhedral gravity field are made and recommendations are given in order to aid planning of proximity operations for future small body missions.},

Future planetary missions may use Interplanetary Laser Ranging (ILR) as a tracking observable. Two-way ILR will provide range data that are about 2 orders of magnitude more accurate than radio-based range data. ILR does not produce Doppler data, however. In this article, we compare the relative strength of radio Doppler and laser range data for the retrieval of parameters of interest in planetary missions, to clarify and quantify the science case of ILR, with a focus on geodetic observables. We first provide an overview of the near-term attainable quality of ILR, in terms of both the realization of the observable and the models used to process the measurements. Subsequently, we analyse the sensitivity of radio Doppler and laser range measurements in representative mission scenarios for parameters of interest. We use both an analytical approximation and numerical analyses of the relative sensitivity of ILR and radio Doppler observables for more general cases. We show that mm-precise range normal points are feasible for ILR, but mm-level accuracy and stability in the full analysis chain are unlikely to be attained, due to a combination of instrumental and model errors. We find that ILR has the potential for superior performance in observing signatures in the data with a characteristic period of greater than 0.33–1.65 hours (assuming 2–10 mm uncertainty for range and 10 μ m/s at 60 s for Doppler). This indicates that Doppler tracking will typically remain the method of choice for gravity field determination and spacecraft orbit determination in planetary missions. ILR data will be able to supplement the orbiter tracking data used for the estimation of parameters with a once-per-orbit signal. Laser ranging data, however, are shown to have a significant advantage for the retrieval of rotational and tidal characteristics from landers. Similarly, laser ranging data will be superior for the construction of planetary ephemerides and the improvement of solar system tests of gravitation, both for orbiter and for lander missions.},

    abstract = {The ESA Tracking Stations Network (ESTRACK) supports the Agency’s and 3rd party spacecraft, during both critical and routine mission phases. In order to ensure the required continuous and reliable communication capability, a set of ground stations are placed at the Australian, American and European longitudes. In addition, an ESA terminal is hosted at Malindi, Kenya. As from 1968 this ground stations network has been augmented as mandated by mission requirements, whilst maintaining a general-purpose character to the maximum extent possible. The latter ensures integrity of the network, common interfaces to control centers, efficient spare holding capabilities, and thus its cost efficient operations and maintenance. After having developed and operated a European network supporting low and near Earth spacecraft (e.g. Kiruna, Redu, Kourou), in the last years ESA focus has been put on the sustaining and development of a LEOP infrastructure (Kourou, Malindi and New-Norcia) and deep-space infrastructure (located in Australia, Spain and Argentina). At the same time, ESA has developed a partnership with cooperative agreements and commercial suppliers complementing the ESA capabilities for the support of critical and routine operations in the earh-Earth domain. This paper focuses on the strategic evolution of ESTRACK, ensuring that such strategic asset for Europe will be able to support the ESA future missions roadmap.},

    abstract = {We processed and analyzed one-way laser ranging data from International Laser Ranging Service ground stations to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), obtained from June 13, 2009 until September 30, 2014. We pair and analyze the one-way range observables from station laser fire and spacecraft laser arrival times by using nominal LRO orbit models based on the GRAIL gravity field. We apply corrections for instrument range walk, as well as for atmospheric and relativistic effects. In total we derived a tracking data volume of ≈ 3000 hours featuring 64 million Full Rate and 1.5 million Normal Point observations. From a statistical analysis of the dataset we evaluate the experiment and the ground station performance. We observe a laser ranging measurement precision of 12.3 cm in case of the Full Rate data which surpasses the LOLA timestamp precision of 15 cm. The averaging to Normal Point data further reduces the measurement precision to 5.6 cm. We characterized the LRO clock with fits throughout the mission time and estimated the rate to 6.9 × 10−8, the aging to 1.6 × 10−12/day and the change of aging to 2.3 × 10−14 /day2over all mission phases. The fits also provide referencing of onboard time to the TDB time scale at a precision of 166 ns over two and 256 ns over all mission phases, representing ground to space time transfer. Furthermore we measure ground station clock differences from the fits as well as from simultaneous passes which we use for ground to ground time transfer from common view observations. We observed relative offsets ranging from 33 to 560 ns and relative rates ranging from 2 × 10−13 to 6 × 10−12 between the ground station clocks during selected mission phases. We study the results from the different methods and discuss their applicability for time transfer.},

    abstract = {We used one-way laser ranging data from International Laser Ranging Service (ILRS) ground stations to NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) for a demonstration of orbit determination. In the one-way setup, the state of LRO and the parameters of the spacecraft and all involved ground station clocks must be estimated simultaneously. This setup introduces many correlated parameters that are resolved by using a priori constraints. Moreover the observation data coverage and errors accumulating from the dynamical and the clock modeling limit the maximum arc length. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of the arc length, the dynamical and modeling accuracy and the observation data coverage on the accuracy of the results. We analyzed multiple arcs using lengths of 2 and 7 days during a one-week period in Science Mission phase 02 (SM02, November 2010) and compared the trajectories, the post-fit measurement residuals and the estimated clock parameters. We further incorporated simultaneous passes from multiple stations within the observation data to investigate the expected improvement in positioning. The estimated trajectories were compared to the nominal LRO trajectory and the clock parameters (offset, rate and aging) to the results found in the literature. Arcs estimated with one-way ranging data had differences of 5–30 m compared to the nominal LRO trajectory. While the estimated LRO clock rates agreed closely with the a priori constraints, the aging parameters absorbed clock modeling errors with increasing clock arc length. Because of high correlations between the different ground station clocks and due to limited clock modeling accuracy, their differences only agreed at the order of magnitude with the literature. We found that the incorporation of simultaneous passes requires improved modeling in particular to enable the expected improvement in positioning. We found that gaps in the observation data coverage over 12 h (≈6 successive LRO orbits) prevented the successful estimation of arcs with lengths shorter or longer than 2 or 7 days with our given modeling.},

Moreover, we have now available a practical method for estimating fragment ejection velocities in interasteroid collisional events. This can be easily implemented in numerical models of the collisional evolution of the asteroid belt. In particular, it should be possible to undertake a more quantitative assessment of the efficiency of collisional events in the Main Belt as the sources of near Earth asteroids of different sizes.},

Equating thermal radiation and blast effects observed at the two cities subsequent to the explosions gives a yield of about 15 kt. The pressure-vs-time data, obtained by dropped, parachute-retarded canisters and reevaluated using 2-D hydrodynamic calculations, give a yield between 16 and 17 kt. Scaling the gamma-ray dose data and calculations gives a yield of about 15 kt. Sulfur neutron activation data give a yield of about 15 kt. The current best estimates for the yield of these explosions are the following: Hiroshima 15 kt Nagasaki 21 kt The outside limits of uncertainties in these values are believed to be 20 percent for Hiroshima and 10 percent for Nagasaki.},

   abstract = {Close approaching (or impacting) asteroids can have slow apparent motion in some directions in the sky as they approach Earth. For some objects that approach Earth from east of opposition, the induced topocentric motion coming from Earth's rotation cancels the natural eastward motion in the sky, making the object appear to be almost stationary, This makes discovery difficult. Near-Earth asteroid 2019 OK passed within about 70000 km of Earth on 2019 July 25.06. It evaded discovery inbound, and despite its ∼100 m size and approaching from the nighttime side of Earth, was first seen only about 24 h before closest approach. The reasons why various surveys did not detect it are analyzed. It is compared to a range of synthetic impactors and the appearance of impactors coming from various directions in the nighttime sky is discussed. 2019 OK appeared to be almost stationary, and as a result was not detected as a moving object. Some impacting objects approaching from east of opposition will likely have similar slow motion to 2019 OK. Detection of slow moving nearby objects is a new, unrecognized challenge for Near-Earth Object surveys.},
